# Firebase Setup Guide for AceMyInterview Dashboard

## Firestore Index Requirements

To enable full dashboard functionality, you need to create Firestore indexes for efficient querying. 

### Automatic Index Creation

When you first use the dashboard, you might see console messages about required indexes. Firebase will automatically provide URLs to create these indexes.

### Manual Index Creation (Optional)

If you want to create indexes manually, go to the Firebase Console:

1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: `radhakrishna-8d46e`
3. Go to Firestore Database → Indexes
4. Create the following composite indexes:

#### Index 1: Interview Sessions
- Collection: `interviewSessions`
- Fields:
  - `userId` (Ascending)
  - `timestamp` (Descending)

#### Index 2: Interview Assessments  
- Collection: `interviewAssessments`
- Fields:
  - `userId` (Ascending)
  - `timestamp` (Descending)

### Current Fallback Solution

The dashboard has been configured with fallback queries that work without indexes:
- ✅ Fetches user data without compound queries
- ✅ Sorts results in memory instead of database
- ✅ Provides demo data for new users
- ✅ Graceful error handling for missing indexes

### Dashboard Features Available Without Indexes

- User progress metrics
- Visual charts and analytics  
- AI recommendations
- Quick navigation to practice modes
- Session tracking (once you complete interviews)

### Dashboard Features Enhanced With Indexes

- Faster data loading
- Real-time session updates
- Optimized database queries
- Better performance with large datasets

## Getting Started

1. **Login/Register** - Use Firebase authentication
2. **Take Practice Interviews** - Start with MCQ or coding questions
3. **Try Face-to-Face Interview** - Get AI-powered assessment
4. **View Progress** - Dashboard populates with your session data

The application works perfectly without manual index creation - Firebase handles optimization automatically!
