# Alternative: RapidAPI Judge0 Setup (Cloud-hosted)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Use RapidAPI Instead of Self-Hosted?

**Docker Desktop on Windows** has limitations with Linux cgroups and isolated filesystems. Judge0 requires:
- cgroups for resource limiting
- `/box` directory for isolated code execution
- Full system privileges for sandboxing

These don't work well on Windows Docker Desktop, causing errors like:
- `No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /box/script.py`
- `Failed to create control group /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/box-X/`

**Solution:** Use RapidAPI's cloud-hosted Judge0 service (free tier available!)

## üîß Configuration Code

The app automatically detects if you're using RapidAPI. The `judge0Config.js` checks:

```javascript
if (JUDGE0_CONFIG.baseUrl.includes('rapidapi')) {
  headers['X-RapidAPI-Key'] = JUDGE0_CONFIG.apiKey;
  headers['X-RapidAPI-Host'] = 'judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com';
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid API Key"
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you copied the full key from RapidAPI
- Check for extra spaces in `.env` file
- Make sure the key starts with the right prefix

### Issue: "Rate Limit Exceeded"
**Solution:**
- You've used your 50 free requests for the day
- Wait 24 hours or upgrade plan
- Or use self-hosted on a Linux machine

### Issue: "Network Error"
**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- RapidAPI might be down (rare) - check status at https://status.rapidapi.com

## üîÑ Switch Back to Self-Hosted (Linux Only)

If you're on **Linux or WSL2 with proper Docker**, you can use self-hosted:

```env
# Switch to self-hosted
VITE_JUDGE0_BASE_URL=http://localhost:2358
VITE_JUDGE0_HOST=localhost
# Remove or comment out VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run judge0:setup
```
