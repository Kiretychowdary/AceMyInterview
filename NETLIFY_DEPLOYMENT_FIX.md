# 🔧 Netlify Deployment Fix Applied

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**
```
Failed during stage 'Reading and parsing configuration files': 
When resolving config file /opt/build/repo/netlify.toml:
Could not parse configuration file
Can't redefine existing key at row 18, col 19, pos 524:
18> [build.environment]
```

## 🎯 **Root Cause:**
- **Duplicate `[build.environment]` sections** in `netlify.toml`
- TOML format doesn't allow duplicate keys/sections
- Section was split across lines 12 and 18

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### **Before (Broken):**
```toml
[build.environment]
  VITE_API_BASE_URL = "https://acemyinterview-production.up.railway.app"
  VITE_API_URL = "https://acemyinterview-production.up.railway.app/api"
  VITE_APP_NAME = "AceMyInterview"
  VITE_APP_VERSION = "1.0.0"

[build.environment]  ← DUPLICATE SECTION!
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  VITE_API_BASE_URL = "https://acemyinterview.onrender.com"
  VITE_API_URL = "https://acemyinterview.onrender.com/api"
  VITE_APP_NAME = "AceMyInterview"
  VITE_APP_VERSION = "1.0.0"
```

## 🚀 **Changes Made:**
1. ✅ **Merged duplicate sections** into single `[build.environment]`
2. ✅ **Updated backend URLs** to use Render instead of Railway
3. ✅ **Added NODE_VERSION = "18"** for compatibility
4. ✅ **Committed and pushed** the fix

## 🎯 **Result:**
- **Netlify deployment should now succeed**
- **Frontend will connect to your Render backend**
- **Dynamic AI questions will work in production**

## 📝 **Next Steps:**
1. **Check Netlify dashboard** - new deployment should trigger automatically
2. **Verify deployment succeeds** this time
3. **Test live site** for dynamic question generation

**The fix has been applied and pushed to your repository! 🎉**
