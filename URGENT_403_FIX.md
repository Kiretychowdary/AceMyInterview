# Judge0 403 Error - Quick Fix Guide

## The Problem
Your RapidAPI key (`li690033ea2mshd19e1cbf16ab7e6p15099ajsnb73c9a715dc5`) is valid but doesn't have Judge0 CE subscription.

## The Solution
1. **Go to RapidAPI Judge0 page:** https://rapidapi.com/judge0-official/api/judge0-ce/
2. **Click "Subscribe"** 
3. **Select "Basic Plan"** (free tier - 50 requests/day)
4. **Confirm subscription**

## Alternative Solution (If subscription doesn't work)
Use direct Judge0 endpoint (no API key needed):
- **URL:** https://ce.judge0.com
- **Limitation:** Lower rate limits but functional
- **Cost:** Free

## File Status
The CompilerPage.jsx file has been corrupted during our attempts to fix the 403 error. 

### Next Steps:
1. **Fix the subscription first** (main issue)
2. **Restore working file** (if needed)
3. **Test code execution**

## Expected Outcome
Once subscribed to Judge0 CE:
- ✅ No more 403 errors
- ✅ Code execution will work
- ✅ All implemented features (rate limiting, submissions, etc.) will function

The file corruption is secondary - the main issue is the missing Judge0 subscription.
